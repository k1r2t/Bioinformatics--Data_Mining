# Bioinformatics--Data_Mining
🔬 Mining Gene-Disease Links in the Gut Microbiome | Extracting gene-disease associations from NCBI, DisGeNET, and OMIM, cleaning &amp; structuring data, applying NLP on PubMed, and visualizing connections using NetworkX &amp; Cytoscape. A bioinformatics project uncovering key insights in gut health &amp; disease. 🚀🧬

## 📖 Overview
Understanding the link between genes and diseases in the gut microbiome is key to unlocking new insights in bioinformatics. This project extracts, analyzes, and visualizes gene-disease associations using public databases, **APIs, NLP techniques, and network visualization** to reveal meaningful connections.

## 📂 Data Sources
We leverage multiple bioinformatics databases:
- 🔬 **NCBI** – Gene and protein sequences.
- 🧬 **DisGeNET** – Comprehensive gene-disease associations.
- 🏥 **OMIM** – Human genes and genetic disorders.
- 📚 **PubMed** – Research articles for NLP-based text mining.

## 📊 Workflow
1. **Data Extraction** – Retrieve gene-disease association data via APIs.
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
3. **NLP Analysis** – Extract insights from PubMed abstracts.
4. **Network Visualization** – Use **NetworkX & Cytoscape** to map gene-disease relationships.

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation
### Prerequisites
